# LinkedIn Resume Detector Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that automatically detects and highlights LinkedIn profiles with attached resumes/CVs on search results pages. Save time by quickly identifying candidates who have uploaded their resumes without clicking into each profile.

- ‚ö° **Real-time Updates**: Checks profiles as you scroll and browse
- üéõÔ∏è **Customizable Settings**: Adjust check delays and concurrent limits
- üíæ **Smart Caching**: Remembers previously checked profiles

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to LinkedIn**: Go to [linkedin.com](https://linkedin.com)

2. **Search for people**: Use the search bar to find people (e.g., "java developer")

3. **View results**: Go to the People tab in search results

4. **Watch for indicators**: The extension will automatically start checking profiles:
   - üìÑ **Green badge**: Profile has a resume/CV attached
   - ‚ùå **Grey badge**: No resume found
   - üîÑ **Orange badge**: Currently checking the profile

5. **Use settings**: Click the extension icon to:
   - Enable/disable the extension
   - Adjust check delays
   - View statistics
   - Clear cache or refresh checks

## Settings

### Extension Controls
- **Enable Extension**: Turn the extension on/off
- **Auto Check**: Automatically check profiles as you browse
- **Check Delay**: Time between profile checks (500-5000ms)
- **Max Concurrent Checks**: Maximum simultaneous profile checks (1-10)

### Actions
- **Refresh Check**: Re-scan all visible profiles
- **Clear Cache**: Clear previously checked profile data

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: The extension detects when you're on LinkedIn search results pages

3. **Resume Checking**: For each profile, it makes a request to check for resume indicators
4. **Visual Feedback**: Adds colored badges to indicate resume status
5. **Caching**: Stores results to avoid re-checking the same profiles
6. **Rate Limiting**: Includes delays to avoid overwhelming LinkedIn's servers
